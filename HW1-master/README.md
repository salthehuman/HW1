## Instructions

See inside the `SI364W18_HW1.py` file for details about the four problems to complete in this assignment.

When you are done, there should be at least these 5 routes that work in the Flask app in `SI364W18_HW1.py`:

* `/` (works in the provided code; should not change)
* `/class` (from Problem 1)
* `/movie/<anytitlesearch>` (from Problem 2)
* `/question` (from Problem 3)
* `/problem4form` (from Problem 4)

There may be 1 or 2 more, depending upon how you decide to handle Problems 2-4, but you only need these five working correctly and following all requirements to succeed at completing this homework assignment.
